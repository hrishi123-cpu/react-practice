Each component has several “lifecycle methods” that you can override to run code at particular times in the process

##Mounting
These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

constructor()
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()


##Updating
An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered:

static getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidUpdate()

##Unmounting
This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

componentWillUnmount()


##Error Handling
These methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.

static getDerivedStateFromError()
componentDidCatch()
